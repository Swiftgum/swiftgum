# **Swiftgum**  
**Turn Data into LLM-Ready Markdown**  

Swiftgum is an **open-source** platform that **ingests and normalizes documents from virtually any platform, making them ready for AI-powered applications**. It simplifies data ingestion, **enforces per-user RBAC**, and **exports structured data via webhooks**, so you can send AI-ready content anywhere you need.

## **Quick Start**  

This guide walks you through setting up Swiftgum in five simple steps.  

### **1. Sign Up & Retrieve API Key**  
- **Sign Up**: Visit [Swiftgum](https://swiftgum.com) and create an account.  
- **Reveal Your API Key**:  
  - Log into your **admin dashboard**.  
  - Access the **API Keys** section to copy your `x-api-key`.  

### **2. Activate an Integration**  
- Navigate to **Integrations** in the Swiftgum dashboard.  
- Enable an integration (e.g., Google Drive):  
  - Toggle the integration status to **Enabled**.  
  - Enter OAuth Credentials: Provide **Client ID** and **Client Secret** (or leave blank if pre-configured).  
  - Click **Update Integration** to save changes.  

Once enabled, end users can connect personal or team accounts via the **Swiftgum Portal**.  

### **3. Create a Portal Session**  
- Call the `/api/portal/session` endpoint to generate a `sessionId` for a specific user.  
- This session allows them to manage their newly enabled integration.  

#### **Example Request:**  
```bash
POST /api/portal/session
Host: https://api.swiftgum.com
x-api-key: <YOUR_SWIFTGUM_API_KEY>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "uniqueUserId": "user-123@myapp.com",
  "configuration": {
    "userDisplay": "MyUser",
    "returnUrl": "https://example.com"
  }
}
```

#### **Example Response (200):**  
The response contains a **signed URL** that the developer can directly use in the UI.  
```text
	"https://api.swiftgum.com/portal/sess_abc123"
```

### **4. Redirect User to the Portal**
- Use the **signed URL** returned in the API response to directly connect the end user to Swiftgum.

- Redirect your user to that **signed URL** (e.g., from a ‚ÄúManage Knowledge‚Äù button in your app).
- Users can **authorize Google Drive** (or any enabled integration) and set **permissions**.
- Once finished, they will be sent back to your specified `returnUrl`.

### **5. Configure a Webhook Destination**  
- Navigate to **Webhook Destination** in your **Swiftgum admin dashboard**.  
- Specify your **Endpoint** (e.g., `https://api.yourdomain.com/swiftgum-webhook`).  
  - Swiftgum will send **new or updated content** to this endpoint after each fetch.  
- **Verify Delivery**: Swiftgum will send a **test POST request** to validate connectivity.  

Once configured, your system can **automatically receive structured data** for storage, AI workflows, or additional processing.

## **Installation**  

### **Swiftgum Cloud (Recommended)**  
- No setup required‚Äîsign up at [https://swiftgum.com](https://swiftgum.com)  
- Retrieve your **API key** and start ingesting documents instantly.  

### **Self-Hosted Deployment**  
- Run Swiftgum **locally** or in your own cloud (Docker, Kubernetes, etc.).  

#### **Quick Local Test via Docker**  

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-org/swiftgum.git
cd swiftgum

# 2. Start Swiftgum
docker compose up -d

# 3. Access UI at http://localhost:3000
```
