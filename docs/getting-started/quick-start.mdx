# Quick Start

This guide walks you through setting up KnowledgeX in **three** simple steps.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Sign Up or Install">
        - **Cloud**: [Create an account](https://your-knowledgex-domain.com/signup) on KnowledgeX Cloud.  
        - **Local**: Clone or download the repository and run it locally (e.g., via Docker).  

        After you sign up or install locally, you’ll obtain:
        - `KNOWLEDGEX_URL`: The base URL of your KnowledgeX instance.  
        - `KNOWLEDGEX_TOKEN`: Your generated token for API authentication.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add KnowledgeX to Your App">
        - **Install**:  
            ```bash
            npm install knowledgex
            ```
        - **Configure**: Add environment variables to your `.env` file:
            ```bash
            KNOWLEDGEX_URL=<YOUR_KNOWLEDGEX_URL>
            KNOWLEDGEX_TOKEN=<YOUR_KNOWLEDGEX_TOKEN>
            ```
        - **Initialize**: In your backend or Next.js API route:
            ```js
            import { createKnowledgeXClient } from 'knowledgex'

            const knowledgeXClient = createKnowledgeXClient({
            url: process.env.KNOWLEDGEX_URL,
            token: process.env.KNOWLEDGEX_TOKEN
            })
            ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a Session & Launch the Portal">
        - **Portal Session**: In your backend, you can generate a portal session link for a given user:
            ```js
            // Example pseudo-code
            const portalSessionUrl = await knowledgeXClient.createPortalSession({
            endUserId: 'user_123'
            })
            // Redirect or send this URL to your frontend.
            ```
        - **Redirection Flow**:  
            1. Your user clicks “Manage Knowledge” in your app.  
            2. You call `createPortalSession(...)` to get a secure link.  
            3. The user is **redirected** to KnowledgeX to manage their integrations and data.  

        This pattern is similar to Stripe’s customer portal session flow, providing a secure, short-lived URL.
    </Step>
</Steps>

With these **three** steps, you have a working integration with KnowledgeX. Continue to [Installation](installation.md) for more details on local vs. cloud deployment.
