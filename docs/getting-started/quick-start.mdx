# Quick Start

This guide walks you through setting up Swiftgum in **five** simple steps.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Sign Up & Retrieve API Key">
    1. **Sign Up**  
       Visit [Swiftgum](https://your-swiftgum-domain.com/signup) and create an account.

    2. **Reveal Your API Key**  
       - Log into your admin dashboard.
       - Access the [**API Keys**](/admin/api) section to copy your <code>x-api-key</code>.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Activate an Integration">
    With your admin account, navigate to **Integrations** in the Swiftgum dashboard. For example, to enable Google Drive:

    - **Toggle the Integration**: Switch the integration status to "Enabled".
    - **Enter OAuth Credentials**:  
      - `Client ID` and `Client Secret` (from your Google Developer Console), or leave them blank if already configured.
      - Click **Update Integration** to save changes.

    Once an integration is **Enabled**, end users can connect personal or team accounts via the Swiftgum Portal.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Portal Session">
    Next, call the <code>/api/portal/session</code> endpoint to generate a <strong>sessionId</strong> for a specific user, allowing them to manage their newly enabled integration.

    ```bash
    POST /api/portal/session
    Host: https://api.swiftgum.com
    x-api-key: <YOUR_SWIFTGUM_API_KEY>
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "uniqueUserId": "user-123@myapp.com",
      "configuration": {
        "userDisplay": "MyUser",
        "returnUrl": "https://example.com"
      }
    }
    ```

    **Response (200)**:
    The response contains a **signed URL** that the developer can directly use in the UI.  
    ```text
      "https://api.swiftgum.com/portal/sess_abc123""
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Redirect User to the Portal">
    1. Use the returned <code>sessionId</code> to build a portal link:
       ```text
       https://api.swiftgum.com/portal/<sessionId>
       ```
    2. Redirect your user to that link (e.g., from a “Manage Knowledge” button in your app).
    3. The user can now authorize Google Drive (or any other enabled integration) under their account, set permissions, etc.
    4. After finishing, they’ll be sent back to your specified <code>returnUrl</code>.

    This **short-lived** portal link ensures secure user access to Swiftgum’s integration management without exposing your app’s internal credentials.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure a Webhook Destination">
    By default, Swiftgum functions as an ETL engine—fetching data from the enabled integrations. To receive that data in your system:
    
    1. **Navigate to “Webhook Destination”** in your Swiftgum admin dashboard.
    2. **Specify your Endpoint** (e.g., <code>https://api.yourdomain.com/swiftgum-webhook</code>):
       - Swiftgum will send new or updated content to this endpoint whenever it completes a data fetch.
    3. **Verify Delivery**: Once configured, Swiftgum will attempt a test POST request to ensure it can reach your endpoint.

    After saving, your system can handle incoming data (e.g., store in Supabase, parse for further AI workflows, etc.).
  </Step>

</Steps>

With these **five** steps, you have a working integration with **Swiftgum**—users can manage and authorize their content sources through the portal, and you can automatically receive that data via a webhook.
