# Installation

Depending on your needs, you can **self-host** KnowledgeX or rely on our **cloud** offering. Below is an overview of both approaches.

**Recommended: KnowledgeX Cloud**

If you want the quickest path, sign up for KnowledgeX Cloud and skip server management.

## 1. Cloud Installation

1. **Sign Up**  
   - Register on [KnowledgeX Cloud](https://your-knowledgex-domain.com/signup).  
   - Obtain your `KNOWLEDGEX_URL` and `KNOWLEDGEX_TOKEN` from the dashboard.

2. **Configure Your App**  
   - Set the environment variables:
     ```bash
     KNOWLEDGEX_URL=<YOUR_KNOWLEDGEX_CLOUD_URL>
     KNOWLEDGEX_TOKEN=<YOUR_GENERATED_TOKEN>
     ```
   - Install the KnowledgeX client in your project.

3. **Run**  
   - Everything else is handled on the KnowledgeX Cloudâ€™s end.  
   - Head to [Quick Start](quick-start.md) for usage instructions.

## 2. Local Installation (Docker/Next.js)

For teams requiring **full control**, you can run KnowledgeX on-prem.

1. **Clone the Repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/knowledgex.git
   cd knowledgex

2. **Build & Run Docker**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d

This spins up:

The KnowledgeX server (Next.js or Node)
A local database (SQLite or Postgres)
Obtain Local Credentials

On first run, the server logs or CLI outputs a default `KNOWLEDGEX_URL` (usually http://localhost:3000) and a generated `KNOWLEDGEX_TOKEN`.
Test

Access the local KnowledgeX dashboard at http://localhost:3000/admin.
Use your admin credentials (generated on startup).

Next Steps
Once you have KnowledgeX running (locally or in the cloud), head to the Configuration guide to customize environment variables and manage keys.
