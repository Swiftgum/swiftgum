Depending on your needs, you can **rely on Swiftgum Cloud** or explore private hosting. Below is an overview of both approaches.

## 1. Cloud Installation

1. **Sign Up**  
   - Register on [Swiftgum Cloud](https://your-swiftgum-domain.com/signup).  
   - Log into your admin dashboard to **reveal your `x-api-key`**.

2. **Use the API**  
   - Swiftgumâ€™s endpoint is fixed (e.g., `https://api.swiftgum.com`), so no custom URL is required.
   - **Include** your `x-api-key` header in all requests (see [Quick Start](quick-start.md) for sample code).

3. **Go Live**  
   - Everything else is handled on **Swiftgum Cloud**.  
   - Head to the [Quick Start](quick-start.md) guide to create portal sessions and manage integrations.

## 2. Self-Hosted / On-Prem (Optional)

If you require **full control** over your data and hosting environment, consider **on-prem** deployment:

1. **Contact Swiftgum**  
   - We currently offer an enterprise version for on-prem hosting.  
   - Email [sales@swiftgum.com](mailto:sales@swiftgum.com) (or your relevant contact) for license details and setup instructions.

2. **Installation Steps** (Example)  
   - **Clone the Repo**: Access the private repository your enterprise license grants.  
   - **Docker-Compose** or **Kubernetes**: Build containers and spin them up locally or in your private cloud.  
   - **Configuration**: In your admin UI (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/admin`), retrieve an on-prem `x-api-key` for authenticating your local Swiftgum instance.

3. **Maintenance**  
   - You control updates, backups, and server scaling.  
   - Swiftgum provides occasional patches or new releases that you can pull and redeploy.
