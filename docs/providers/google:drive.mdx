## Getting Started

To connect your Google Drive to Swiftgum, you'll need to create OAuth2 credentials in the Google Cloud Console. Follow this step-by-step guide to set up your credentials.

### Creating OAuth2 Credentials

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project**

   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Click on the project dropdown at the top of the page
   - Click on "New Project"
   - Enter a name for your project and click "Create"

2. **Configure the OAuth Consent Screen**

   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen"
   - Select the appropriate user type (External or Internal)
   - Fill in the required information:
     - App name
     - User support email
     - Developer contact information
   - Click "Save and Continue"
   - Add the necessary scopes (at minimum, you'll need `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`)
   - Click "Save and Continue"
   - Add test users if needed, then click "Save and Continue"
   - Review your settings and click "Back to Dashboard"

3. **Create OAuth Client ID**

   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
   - Select "Web application" as the application type
   - Enter a name for your OAuth client
   - Under "Authorized redirect URIs", add the callback URL from your Swiftgum admin panel
     - You can find this URL in the Swiftgum admin panel under Integrations > Google Drive
   - Click "Create"

4. **Save Your Credentials**
   - After creating the client ID, you'll be presented with your Client ID and Client Secret
   - Save these credentials securely as you'll need to enter them in Swiftgum

### Configuring Swiftgum

1. Go to your Swiftgum admin panel
2. Navigate to Integrations > Google Drive
3. Enter the Client ID and Client Secret you obtained from Google Cloud Console
4. Save your settings

Your Google Drive integration should now be ready to use with Swiftgum.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter authentication errors, ensure that your redirect URI exactly matches what's configured in Google Cloud Console
- For production applications, you may need to verify your app through Google's verification process
- Make sure you've enabled the necessary scopes for your use case
