## Getting Started

To connect your Notion workspace to Swiftgum, you'll need to create an integration in the Notion developer portal. Follow this step-by-step guide to set up your integration.

### Creating a Notion Integration

1. **Create a Notion Integration**

   - Go to the [Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations) page
   - Click on "New integration"
   - Enter a name for your integration (e.g., "Swiftgum Integration")
   - Select the workspace where you want to use the integration
   - Upload an icon (optional)
   - Click "Submit" to create your integration

2. **Configure Capabilities and Authorization**

   - In your integration settings, navigate to the "Capabilities" section
   - Enable the capabilities required for your use case:
     - Read content (required)
     - Update content (if needed)
     - Insert content (if needed)
   - Under "Authorization", select "Public integration" if you plan to distribute your app
   - For "Redirect URIs", add the callback URL from your Swiftgum admin panel
     - You can find this URL in the Swiftgum admin panel under Integrations > Notion

3. **Get Your API Credentials**

   - After creating the integration, you'll be provided with an "Internal Integration Token"
   - Copy this token as you'll need to enter it in Swiftgum
   - If you're building a public integration, you'll also receive an "OAuth Client ID" and "Client Secret"

4. **Share Pages with Your Integration**
   - In your Notion workspace, navigate to the pages you want to connect to Swiftgum
   - Click the "..." menu in the top-right corner of the page
   - Select "Add connections" and choose your integration
   - This grants your integration access to the specific pages

### Configuring Swiftgum

1. Go to your Swiftgum admin panel
2. Navigate to Integrations > Notion
3. Enter the Integration Token (for internal integrations) or Client ID and Client Secret (for public integrations)
4. Save your settings

Your Notion integration should now be ready to use with Swiftgum.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter permission errors, ensure that you've shared the necessary pages with your integration
- For public integrations, verify that your redirect URI exactly matches what's configured in the Notion developer portal
- Note that Notion API has rate limits that may affect performance for large workspaces
- Make sure you've enabled the necessary capabilities for your use case
