<Callout type="info">
Swiftgum leverages <Tooltip text="RBAC stands for Role-Based Access Control">RBAC</Tooltip> to ensure users only interact with data and configurations theyâ€™re allowed to see.
</Callout>

## Overview

<Steps>
  <Step icon="code">
    **Developers & Admins:** Configure OAuth apps and manage workspaces.
  </Step>
  <Step icon="user">
    **End Users:** Connect personal accounts or retrieve documents.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Admins">
    <p>
      Admins (or workspace owners) have full control to add integrations, revoke tokens, and view logs of ingestion events.
    </p>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="End Users">
    <p>
      End Users can manage only their own tokens and files, ensuring privacy and minimal exposure.

## Permission Layers

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Workspace Ownership">
    Each workspace is typically owned by a single admin user with top-level privileges. Owners can add or remove other admin-level users or invite standard users.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Integration Ownership">
    Creating or configuring integrations requires admin rights. End Users may connect personal accounts under these integrations, which generate individual tokens.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Token-Level Access">
    End users can view only their own tokens, while admins can revoke any token as needed. Note that raw OAuth credentials remain encrypted and are not directly exposed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Compliance & Logging

<Warning>
    **Audit Trails:** Every change to roles, tokens, or integrations is logged with a timestamp, actor (admin or system), and a record of the modifications. These audit logs support compliance with standards such as SOC 2 and GDPR.
</Warning>

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Data Minimization">
    Swiftgum only stores file contents when ingestion is explicitly enabled. Otherwise, it retains only references or metadata about files unless a local ingestion pipeline is used for transformation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Best Practices">
    - **Least Privilege:** Grant only the minimum permissions necessary.
    - **Regular Reviews:** Monitor logs for changes or suspicious revocations.
    - **Segmentation:** Use separate workspaces for different teams to minimize cross-access.
