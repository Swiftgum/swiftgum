Swiftgum ensures that **tokens** (user OAuth tokens) and **API credentials** (e.g., client secrets) are stored in an **encrypted** format—minimizing risk even if the database is compromised.

<Info>
**Why Encryption Matters**
Storing tokens in plaintext is a major security risk. Swiftgum uses an **encryption key** to scramble all sensitive fields, preventing unauthorized use or exposure.

  <Accordion title="1. Encryption at Rest">
  
  **Implementation Details**
  
  **Master Encryption Key**  
  - Configured via `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (or a secrets manager if self-hosted).  
  - Used to encrypt/decrypt fields such as **encrypted_tokenset** and **encrypted_credentials**.
  
  **AES-256 (Recommended)**  
  - We default to strong ciphers (AES-256-GCM or AES-256-CBC) to ensure secure encryption.  
  - A unique Initialization Vector (IV) is generated for each record.
  
  **Secure Storage**  
  - Depending on your deployment, encrypted fields may live in Postgres or a dedicated vault.  
  - **No plaintext** secrets are written to logs or public console output.

  <Accordion title="2. Transport Security (TLS)">
  
  All Swiftgum endpoints must be accessed via HTTPS. This ensures that data in transit (including tokens) isn’t exposed to eavesdroppers or man-in-the-middle attacks.
  
  - **Custom SSL**: For self-hosted setups, add an SSL certificate to your server or load balancer.
  - **Cloud**: Swiftgum Cloud enforces TLS by default.
  
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="3. Managing Keys & Rotation">
  
  **Key Generation**  
  - Use a strong, randomly generated string for your `ENCRYPTION_KEY`.  
  - Avoid guessable passphrases or storing the key in source control.
  
  **Rotation**  
  - Periodically rotate your encryption key.
  - Swiftgum provides a tool/CLI to re-encrypt existing records with a new key.
  - **Warning**: Ensure you have backups and a tested rotation process to avoid data loss.
  
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="4. Access Controls">
  
  - **Admin-Only**: Only administrators can configure or rotate encryption keys.
  - **Zero-Knowledge**: The raw key is never displayed in the admin UI or logs.
  
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="5. Audit & Compliance">
  
  - **Encryption Logs**: When specific fields are decrypted or re-encrypted, an event is recorded.
  - **Compliance**: Strong encryption supports compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC 2 data security requirements.

After ensuring your tokens and credentials are protected at rest (and in transit), review our RBAC & Permissions guide for more details on controlling data access.
